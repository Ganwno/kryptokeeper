<h1>Kryptokeeper</h1>

<p>A ReactJS app that was created in a week as Juno's independent 3rd project as an exercise to demonstrate familiarity with React fundamentals.</p>
<p>This app is intended to function as a crypocurrency investment simulator, allowing the user to register for an account, add funds, then buy and sell various cryptocurrency while also charting their profits and losses to date. It employs a scratch built login & verification function, and makes use of a variety of React functions to consistently update cryptocurrency prices (useEffect) as well as avoid issues like prop drilling (useContext). Employs responsive design to ensure usability in both desktop and mobile resolutions</p>
